## 🧠 About Me

Hello, **I'm Komal Goykar — a passionate Full Stack Developer with expertise in Java and the MERN stack.**
I specialize in building scalable, maintainable web applications using technologies like React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, along with Java-based backend frameworks such as Spring Boot, Hibernate, JSP, and Servlets.

With hands-on experience in creating RESTful APIs and responsive UIs, I enjoy collaborating on real-world projects that solve meaningful problems. I'm well-versed with GitHub, Postman, and other development tools, and I continuously seek opportunities to learn and grow in dynamic tech environments.

Beyond coding, I find joy in nature and photography, which keeps me inspired and balanced.
